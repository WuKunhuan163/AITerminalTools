      "abstract": "Dense 3D representations of the environment have been a long-term goal in the\nrobotics field. While previous Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) representation\nhave been prevalent for its implicit, coordinate-based model, the recent\nemergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable potential\nin its explicit radiance field representation. By leveraging 3D Gaussian\nprimitives for explicit scene representation and enabling differentiable\nrendering, 3DGS has shown significant advantages over other radiance fields in\nreal-time rendering and photo-realistic performance, which is beneficial for\nrobotic applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive understanding\nof 3DGS in the field of robotics. We divide our discussion of the related works\ninto two main categories: the application of 3DGS and the advancements in 3DGS\ntechniques. In the application section, we explore how 3DGS has been utilized\nin various robotics tasks from scene understanding and interaction\nperspectives. The advance of 3DGS section focuses on the improvements of 3DGS\nown properties in its adaptability and efficiency, aiming to enhance its\nperformance in robotics. We then summarize the most commonly used datasets and\nevaluation metrics in robotics. Finally, we identify the challenges and\nlimitations of current 3DGS methods and discuss the future development of 3DGS\nin robotics.",

      "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for 3D scene\nrepresentation, providing rapid rendering speeds and high fidelity. As 3DGS\ngains prominence, safeguarding its intellectual property becomes increasingly\ncrucial since 3DGS could be used to imitate unauthorized scene creations and\nraise copyright issues. Existing watermarking methods for implicit NeRFs cannot\nbe directly applied to 3DGS due to its explicit representation and real-time\nrendering process, leaving watermarking for 3DGS largely unexplored. In\nresponse, we propose WATER-GS, a novel method designed to protect 3DGS\ncopyrights through a universal watermarking strategy. First, we introduce a\npre-trained watermark decoder, treating raw 3DGS generative modules as\npotential watermark encoders to ensure imperceptibility. Additionally, we\nimplement novel 3D distortion layers to enhance the robustness of the embedded\nwatermark against common real-world distortions of point cloud data.\nComprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that WATER-GS\neffectively embeds imperceptible and robust watermarks into 3DGS without\ncompromising rendering efficiency and quality. Our experiments indicate that\nthe 3D distortion layers can yield up to a 20% improvement in accuracy rate.\nNotably, our method is adaptable to different 3DGS variants, including 3DGS\ncompression frameworks and 2D Gaussian splatting.",
