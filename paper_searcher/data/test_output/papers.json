      "abstract": "Machine learning develops rapidly, which has made many theoretical\nbreakthroughs and is widely applied in various fields. Optimization, as an\nimportant part of machine learning, has attracted much attention of\nresearchers. With the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of\nmodel complexity, optimization methods in machine learning face more and more\nchallenges. A lot of work on solving optimization problems or improving\noptimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The\nsystematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the\nperspective of machine learning are of great significance, which can offer\nguidance for both developments of optimization and machine learning research.\nIn this paper, we first describe the optimization problems in machine learning.\nThen, we introduce the principles and progresses of commonly used optimization\nmethods. Next, we summarize the applications and developments of optimization\nmethods in some popular machine learning fields. Finally, we explore and give\nsome challenges and open problems for the optimization in machine learning.",

      "abstract": "I describe an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the\ndynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and\nthe control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard\nto detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning,\nincluding test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward\nshaping. The view encourages adversarial machine learning researcher to utilize\nadvances in control theory and reinforcement learning.",
