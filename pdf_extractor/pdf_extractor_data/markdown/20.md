when comparing (5) and (2) would indicate the time term in (6) was required to improve the complete model and is therefore signiÔ¨Åcant, and vice versa. Due to the constraint that the rainfall and time term must be positive, a one tailed t-test was applied. The t-value was calculated as F0.5, and compared with the critical value for signiÔ¨Åcance at the 0.05 level. The F-statistic was calculated as:

F Z ¬Ω√∞SSEs KSSEc√û=√∞dfc Kdfs√û SSEc=dfc (7) where SSE is the residual sum of the squared errors, df is degrees of freedom, and the subscripts s and c refer to the simpliÔ¨Åed model and complete models, respectively.

3. Data sets Daily streamÔ¨Çow data were obtained from 10 catchment studies from southeastern Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The initial criteria for selection of these catchments were a known vegetation history and streamÔ¨Çow records of good quality. The ideal data sets were those with a lengthy pre- and post-treatment (plantation establishment) Ô¨Çow record with approximately 100% of the catchment converted from grassland or a crop equivalent to plantation. In reality, all these criteria were not easy to satisfy. For example in Victoria, Australia, the best data is from Stewarts Creek, a set of decommissioned research catchments with 9 years of pre-treatment data and 25 years of post-treatment. Here, though, the treatment was a conversion from native eucalypt forest to pine. The assumption made for this data set is that the immediate post-treatment period may be viewed as a non-forested condition. This condition is likely to approximate the ET conditions of pasture or short crops for up to 3 years. Catchment details and treatments are given in Table 1. All catchments, with the exception of Traralgon Creek, were afforested with pine species, predominantly Pinus radiata, with P. patula planted at the two Cathedral Peak catchments. Traralgon Creek has only 6% pine, with the remainder eucalypts species, most of which is Eucalyptus regnans.
