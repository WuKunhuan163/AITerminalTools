Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information, leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with Gaussian splatting that achieves high rendering quality with only 4 input images. We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination, which explicitly inject structure priors into the initial optimization process to help build multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. We further design a COLMAP-free variant, where pre-given accurate camera poses are not required, which achieves competitive quality and facilitates wider applications. GaussianObject is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, OpenIllumination, and our-collected unposed images, achieving superior performance from only four views and significantly outperforming previous SOTA methods. Our demo is available at https://gaussianobject.github.io/, and the code has been released at https://github.com/GaussianObject/GaussianObject.

Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from 2D images has been a long-standing and important topic, which plays critical roles in a vast range of real-life applications. One key factor that impedes users, especially ones without expert knowledge, from widely using these techniques is that usually dozens of multi-view images need to be captured, which is cumbersome and sometimes impractical. Efficiently reconstructing high-quality 3D objects from highly sparse captured images is of great value for expediting downstream applications such as 3D asset creation for game/movie production and AR/VR products. In recent years, a series of methods [Guangcong et al. 2023; Jain et al. 2021; Niemeyer et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2024b; Song et al. 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; Zhou and Tulsiani 2023; Zhu et al. 2024] have been proposed to reduce reliance on dense captures. However, it is still challenging to produce high-quality 3D objects when the views become extremely sparse, e.g. only 4 images in a 360◦range, as shown in Fig. 1. We delve into the task of sparse-view reconstruction and discover two main challenges behind it. The first one lies in the difficulty of building multi-view consistency from highly sparse input. The 3D representation is easy to overfit the input images and degrades into fragmented pixel patches of training views without reasonable structures. The other challenge is that with sparse captures in a 360◦range, some content of the object can be inevitably omitted or severely compressed when observed from extreme views1. The omitted or compressed information is impossible or hard to be reconstructed in 3D only from the input images. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce GaussianObject, a novel framework designed to reconstruct high-quality 3D objects from as few as 4 input images. We choose 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al. 2023] as the basic representation as it is fast and, more importantly, explicit enough. Benefiting from its point-like structure, we design several techniques for introducing object structure priors, e.g. the basic/rough geometry of the object, to help build multi-view consistency, including visual hull [Laurentini 1994] to locate Gaussians within the object outline and floater elimination to remove outliers. To erase artifacts caused by omitted or highly compressed object information, we propose a Gaussian repair model driven by 2D large diffusion models [Rombach et al. 2022], translating corrupted rendered images into high-fidelity ones. As normal diffusion models lack the ability to repair corrupted images, we design self-generating strategies to construct image pairs to tune the diffusion models, including rendering images from leaveone-out training models and adding 3D noises to Gaussian attributes. Images generated from the repair model can be used to refine the 3D Gaussians optimized with structure priors, where the rendering quality can be further improved. To further extend GaussianObject to practical applications, we introduce a COLMAP-free variant of GaussianObject (CF-GaussianObject), which achieves competitive 1When the view is orthogonal to the surface of the object, the observed information attached to the surface can be largely preserved; On the contrary, the information will be severely compressed.

1 INTRODUCTION Vanilla NeRF struggles in sparse settings. Techniques like Deng et al. [2022]; Roessle et al. [2022]; Somraj et al. [2024, 2023]; Somraj and Soundararajan [2023] use Structure from Motion (SfM) [Schönberger and Frahm 2016] derived visibility or depth and mainly focus on closely aligned views. Xu et al. [2022] uses ground truth depth maps, which are costly to obtain in real-world images. Some methods [Guangcong et al. 2023; Song et al. 2023b] estimate depths with monocular depth estimation models [Ranftl et al. 2021, 2022] or sensors, but these are often too coarse. Jain et al. [2021] uses a vision-language model [Radford et al. 2021] for unseen view rendering, but the semantic consistency is too high-level to guide lowlevel reconstruction. Shi et al. [2024b] combines a deep image prior with factorized NeRF, effectively capturing overall appearance but missing fine details in input views. Priors based on information theory [Kim et al. 2022], continuity [Niemeyer et al. 2022], symmetry [Seo et al. 2023], and frequency regularization [Song et al. 2023a; Yang et al. 2023] are only effective for specific scenarios, limiting their further applications. Besides, there are some methods [Jang and Agapito 2024; Jiang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024c; Zou et al. 2024] that employ Vision Transformer (ViT) [Dosovitskiy et al. 2021] to reduce the requirements for constructing NeRFs and Gaussians. The recent progress in diffusion models has spurred notable advancements in 3D applications. Dreamfusion [Poole et al. 2023] proposes Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) for distilling NeRFs with 2D priors from a pre-trained diffusion model for 3D object generation from text prompts. It has been further refined for textto-3D [Chen et al. 2023; Lin et al. 2023; Metzer et al. 2023; Shi et al. 2024a; Tang et al. 2024b; Wang et al. 2023a,b; Yi et al. 2024] and 3D/4D editing [Haque et al. 2023; Shao et al. 2024] by various studies, demonstrating the versatility of 2D diffusion models in 3D contexts. Burgess et al. [2024]; Chan et al. [2023]; Liu et al. [2023c]; Müller et al. [2024]; Pan et al. [2024]; Zhu and Zhuang [2024] have adapted these methods for 3D generation and view synthesis from a single image, while they often have strict input requirements and can produce overly saturated images. In sparse reconstruction, approaches like DiffusioNeRF [Wynn and Turmukhambetov 2023], SparseFusion [Zhou and Tulsiani 2023], Deceptive-NeRF [Liu et al. 2023b], ReconFusion [Wu et al. 2024] and CAT3D [Gao et al. 2024] integrate diffusion models with NeRFs. Recently, Large reconstruction reconstruction performance on challenging datasets with only four input images without inputting accurate camera parameters. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

2 RELATED WORK • We optimize 3D Gaussians from highly sparse views using explicit structure priors, introducing techniques of visual hull for initialization and floater elimination for training. • We propose a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to remove artifacts caused by omitted or highly compressed information, where the rendering quality can be further improved. • The overall framework GaussianObject consistently outperforms current SOTA methods on several challenging real-world datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A COLMAP-free variant is further presented for wider applications, weakening the requirement of accurate camera poses.

models (LRMs) [Hong et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Tang et al. 2024a; Wang et al. 2024b; Wei et al. 2024; Weng et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2024a,b; Zhang et al. 2024] also achieve 3D reconstruction from highly sparse views. Though effective in generating images fast, these methods encounter issues with large pretraining, strict requirements on view distribution and object location, and difficulty in handling real-world captures. While 3DGS shows strong power in novel view synthesis, it struggles with sparse 360◦views similar to NeRF. Inspired by few-shot NeRFs, methods [Charatan et al. 2024; Chung et al. 2023; Paliwal et al. 2024; Xiong et al. 2023; Zhu et al. 2024] have been developed for sparse 360◦reconstruction. However, they still severely rely on the SfM points. Our GaussianObject proposes structure-prior-aided Gaussian initialization to tackle this issue, drastically reducing the required input views to only 4, a significant improvement compared with over 20 views required by FSGS [Zhu et al. 2024].

The subsequent sections detail the methodology: Sec. 3.1 reviews foundational techniques; Sec. 3.2 introduces our overall framework; Sec. 3.3 describes how we apply the structure priors for initial optimization; Sec. 3.4 details the setup of our Gaussian repair model; Sec. 3.5 illustrates the repair of 3D Gaussians using this model and Sec. 3.6 elucidates the COLMAP-free version of GaussianObject. To facilitate a better understanding, all key mathematical symbols and their corresponding meanings are listed in Table 1.

3 METHOD 3.1 Preliminary 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023] represents 3D scenes with 3D Gaussians. Each 3D Gaussian is composed of the center location 𝜇, rotation quaternion𝑞, scaling vector𝑠, opacity 𝜎, and spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients 𝑠ℎ. Thus, a scene is parameterized as a set of Gaussians G = {𝐺𝑖: 𝜇𝑖,𝑞𝑖,𝑠𝑖, 𝜎𝑖,𝑠ℎ𝑖}𝑃 𝑖=1. ControlNet. Diffusion models are generative models that sample from a data distribution 𝑞(𝑋0), beginning with Gaussian noise 𝜖 and using various sampling schedulers. They operate by reversing a discrete-time stochastic noise addition process {𝑋𝑡}𝑇 𝑡=0 with a diffusion model 𝑝𝜃(𝑋𝑡−1|𝑋𝑡) trained to approximate 𝑞(𝑋𝑡−1|𝑋𝑡), where 𝑡∈[0,𝑇] is the noise level and 𝜃is the learnable parameters. Substituting 𝑋0 with its latent code 𝑍0 from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [Kingma and Welling 2014] leads to the development of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) [Rombach et al. 2022]. ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023a] further enhances the generative process with additional 𝜇 Center location of Gaussian 𝑞 Rotation quaternion of Gaussian 𝑠 Scale vector of Gaussian 𝜎 Opacity of Gaussian 𝑠ℎ Spherical harmonic coefficients of Gaussian G𝑐 Coarse 3D Gaussians R Diffusion based Gaussian repair model E Latent diffusion encoder of R D Latent diffusion decoder of R 𝑥′ Degraded rendering ˆ𝑥 Image repaired by R 𝜖𝑠 3D Noise added to attributes of G𝑐 𝜖 2D Gaussian noise for fine-tuning 𝜖𝜃 2D Noise predicted by R 𝑐tex Object-specific language prompt P Coarse point cloud predicted by DUSt3R Symbol Meaning 𝑋ref = {𝑥𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 Reference images 𝐾ref = {𝑘𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 Intrinsics of 𝑋ref ˆ𝐾ref Estimated intrinsics of 𝑋ref ˆ𝐾 Estimated shared intrinsics of 𝑋ref 𝑀ref = {𝑚𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 Masks of 𝑋ref Πref = {𝜋𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 Extrinsics of 𝑋ref Πnov Extrinsics of viewpoints in repair path ˆΠref Estimated extrinsics of 𝑋ref

where 𝑐tex and 𝑐img denote the text and image conditioning respectively, and 𝜖𝜃is the Gaussian noise inferred by the diffusion model with parameter 𝜃, ¯𝛼1:𝑇∈(0, 1]𝑇is a decreasing sequence associated with the noise-adding process.

Given a sparse collection of 𝑁reference images 𝑋ref = {𝑥𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1, captured within a 360◦range and encompassing one object, along with the corresponding camera intrinsics2 𝐾ref = {𝑘𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1, extrinsics Πref = {𝜋𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 and masks 𝑀ref = {𝑚𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1 of the object, our target is to obtain a 3D representation G, which can achieve photo-realistic rendering 𝑥= G(𝜋|{𝑥𝑖, 𝜋𝑖,𝑚𝑖}𝑁 𝑖=1) from any viewpoint. To achieve this, we employ the 3DGS model for its simplicity for structure priors embedding and fast rendering capabilities. The process begins with initializing 3D Gaussians using a visual hull [Laurentini 1994], followed by optimization with floater elimination, enhancing the structure of Gaussians. Then we design self-generating strategies to supply sufficient image pairs for constructing a Gaussian repair model, which is used to rectify incomplete object information. The overall framework is shown in Fig. 2.

Sparse views, especially for only 4 images, provide limited 3D information for reconstruction. In this case, SfM points, which are the key for 3DGS initialization, are often absent. Besides, insufficient multi-view consistency leads to ambiguity among shape and appearance, resulting in many floaters during reconstruction. We propose two techniques to initially optimize the 3D Gaussian representation, which take full advantage of structure priors from the limited views and result in a satisfactory outline of the object. Initialization with Visual Hull. To better leverage object structure information from limited reference images, we utilize the view frustums and object masks to create a visual hull as a geometric scaffold for initializing our 3D Gaussians. Compared with the limited number of SfM points in extremely sparse settings, the visual hull provides more structure priors that help build multiview consistency by excluding unreasonable Gaussian distributions. The cost of the visual hull is just several masks derived from sparse 360◦images, which can be easily acquired using current segmentation models such as SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023]. Specifically, points are randomly initialized within the visual hull using rejection sampling: we project uniformly sampled random 3D points onto image planes and retain those within the intersection of all image-space masks. Point colors are averaged from bilinearly interpolated pixel colors across reference image projections. Then we transform these 3D points into 3D Gaussians. For each point, we assign its position as 𝜇and convert its color into 𝑠ℎ. The mean distance between adjacent points forms the scale 𝑠, while the rotation 𝑞is set to a unit quaternion as default. The opacity 𝜎is initialized to a constant value. This 4 • Yang, Li, et al.

3.2 Overall Framework 3.3 Initial Optimization with Structure Priors 2Given that the camera intrinsics are known and fixed, we exclude them from the rendering function for simplicity.

L𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑= E𝑍0,𝑡,𝜖[∥𝜖𝜃(√¯𝛼𝑡𝑍0 + √1 −¯𝛼𝑡𝜖,𝑡,𝑐tex,𝑐img) −𝜖∥2 2], (1) Combining visual hull initialization and floater elimination significantly enhances 3DGS performance for NVS in sparse 360◦contexts. While the fidelity of our reconstruction is generally passable, G𝑐 𝑃Gaussians for each element in G𝑐. We then establish a normative range by computing the mean and standard deviation of these distances. Based on statistical analysis, we exclude Gaussians whose mean neighbor distances exceed the adaptive threshold 𝜏= mean + 𝜆𝑒std. This thresholding process is repeated periodically throughout optimization, where 𝜆𝑒is linearly decreased to 0 to refine the scene representation progressively. Initial Optimization The optimization of G𝑐incorporates color, mask, and monocular depth losses. The color loss combines L1 and D-SSIM losses from 3D Gaussian Splatting:

where 𝑥is the rendering and 𝑥ref is the corresponding reference image. A binary cross entropy (BCE) loss [Jadon 2020] is applied as mask loss:

where 𝑚denotes the object mask. A shift and scale invariant depth loss is utilized to guide geometry:

where 𝐷∗and 𝐷∗ pred are per-frame rendered depths and monocularly estimated depths [Bhat et al. 2023] respectively. The depth values are computed following a normalization strategy [Ranftl et al. 2020]:

where 𝑀denotes the number of valid pixels. The overall loss combines these components:

where 𝜆SSIM, 𝜆m, and 𝜆d control the magnitude of each term. Thanks to the efficient initialization, our training speed is remarkably fast. It only takes 1 minute to train a coarse Gaussian representation G𝑐 at a resolution of 779 × 520.

initialization strategy relies on the initial masks. Despite potential inaccuracies in these masks or unrepresented concavities by the visual hull, we observed that subsequent optimization processes reliably yield high-quality reconstructions. Floater Elimination. While the visual hull builds a coarse estimation of the object geometry, it often contains regions that do not belong to the object due to the inadequate coverage of reference images. These regions usually appear to be floaters, damaging the quality of novel view synthesis. These floaters are problematic as the optimization process struggles to adjust them due to insufficient observational data regarding their position and appearance. To mitigate this issue, we utilize the statistical distribution of distances among the 3D Gaussians to distinguish the primary object and the floaters. This is implemented by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which calculates the average distance to the nearest √ 3.4 Gaussian Repair Model Setup Lref = (1 −𝜆SSIM)L1 + 𝜆SSIMLD−SSIM + 𝜆mLm + 𝜆dLd, (6) L1 = ∥𝑥−𝑥ref∥1, LD-SSIM = 1 −SSIM(𝑥,𝑥ref), (2) Lm = −(𝑚ref log𝑚+ (1 −𝑚ref) log(1 −𝑚)), (3) 𝐷∗= 𝐷−median(𝐷) 1 𝑀 Í𝑀 𝑖=1 |𝐷−median(𝐷)| , (5) Ld = ∥𝐷∗−𝐷∗ pred∥1, (4)

where 𝑐tex denotes an object-specific language prompt, defined as “a photo of [V],” as per Dreambooth [Ruiz et al. 2023]. Specifically, we inject LoRA layers into the text encoder, image condition branch, and U-Net for fine-tuning. Please refer to the Appendix for details.

still suffers in regions that are poorly observed, regions with occlusion, or even unobserved regions. These challenges loom over the completeness of the reconstruction, like the sword of Damocles. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Gaussian repair model R designed to correct the aberrant distribution of G𝑐. Our R takes corrupted rendered images 𝑥′(G𝑐, 𝜋nov) as input and outputs photorealistic and high-fidelity images ˆ𝑥. This image repair capability can be used to refine the 3D Gaussians, leading to learning better structure and appearance details. Sufficient data pairs are essential for training R but are rare in existing datasets. To this end, we adopt two main strategies for generating adequate image pairs, i.e., leave-one-out training and adding 3D noises. For leave-one-out training, we build 𝑁subsets from the 𝑁input images, each containing 𝑁−1 reference images and 1 left-out image 𝑥out. Then we train 𝑁3DGS models with reference images of these subsets, termed as {G𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 . After specific iterations, we use the left-out image 𝑥out to continue training each Gaussian model {G𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 into { ˆG𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 . Throughout this process, the rendered images from the left-out view at different iterations are stored to form the image pairs along with left-out image 𝑥out for training the repair model. Note that training these left-out models costs little, with less than 𝑁minutes in total. The other strategy is to add 3D noises 𝜖𝑠onto Gaussian attributes. The 𝜖𝑠are derived from the mean 𝜇Δ and variance 𝜎Δ of attribute differences between {G𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 and { ˆG𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 . This allows us to render more degraded images 𝑥′(G𝑐(𝜖𝑠), 𝜋ref) at all reference views from the created noisy Gaussians, resulting in extensive image pairs (𝑋′,𝑋ref). We inject LoRA weights and fine-tune a pre-trained ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023b] using the generated image pairs as our Gaussian repair model. The training procedure is shown in Fig. 3. The loss function, based on Eq. 1, is defined as:

Ltune = E𝑥ref,𝑡,𝜖,𝑥′ h ∥(𝜖𝜃(𝑥ref 𝑡,𝑡,𝑥′,𝑐tex) −𝜖)∥2 2 i , (7) GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting • 5 which is similar to SDEdit [Meng et al. 2022]. We then generate a sample ˆ𝑥𝑗from R by running DDIM sampling [Song et al. 2021] over 𝑘= ⌊50 · 𝑡 where E and D are from the VAE model used by the diffusion model. The distances from 𝜋𝑗to Π𝑟𝑒𝑓is used to weight the reliability of ˆ𝑥𝑗, guiding the optimization with a loss function:

where P is an estimated coarse point cloud of the scene, and ˆΠref, ˆ𝐾ref are the predicted camera poses and intrinsics of 𝑋ref, respectively. For CF-GaussianObject, we modify the intrinsic recovery module within DUSt3R, allowing 𝑥𝑖∈𝑋ref to share the same intrinsic ˆ𝐾. This adaption enables the retrieval of P, ˆΠref, and ˆ𝐾. Besides, After training R, we distill its target object priors into G𝑐to refine its rendering quality. The object information near the reference views is abundant. This observation motivates designing distance as a criterion in identifying views that need rectification, leading to distance-aware sampling. Specifically, we establish an elliptical path aligned with the training views and focus on a central point. Arcs near Π𝑟𝑒𝑓, where we assume G𝑐renders high-quality images, form the reference path. The other arcs, yielding renderings, need to be rectified and define the repair path, as depicted in Fig. 4. In each iteration, novel viewpoints, 𝜋𝑗∈Πnov, are randomly sampled among the repair path. For each 𝜋𝑗, we render the corresponding image 𝑥𝑗(G𝑐, 𝜋𝑗), encode it to be E(𝑥𝑗) by the latent diffusion encoder E and pass E(𝑥𝑗) to the image conditioning branch of R. Simultaneously, a cloned E(𝑥𝑗) is disturbed into a noisy latent 𝑧𝑡:

To ensure coherence between 3D Gaussians and reference images, we continue training G𝑐with Lref during the whole Gaussian repair procedure.

3.6 COLMAP-Free GaussianObject (CF-GaussianObject) Current SOTA sparse view reconstruction methods rely on precise camera parameters, including intrinsics and poses, obtained through an SfM pipeline with dense input, limiting their usability in daily applications. This process can be cumbersome and unreliable in sparse-view scenarios where matched features are insufficient for accurate reconstruction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an advanced sparse matching model, DUSt3R [Wang et al. 2024a], into GaussianObject to enable COLMAP-free sparse 360◦reconstruction. Given reference input images 𝑋ref, DUSt3R is formulated as:

The 3DGS model is trained for 10k iterations in the initial optimization, with periodic floater elimination every 500 iterations. The monocular depth for Ld is predicted by ZoeDepth [Bhat et al. 2023]. We use a ControlNetTile [Zhang et al. 2023b] model based on stable diffusion v1.5 [Rombach et al. 2022] as our repair model’s backbone. LoRA [Hu et al. 2022] weights, injected into the text-encoder and transformer blocks using minLoRA [Chang 2023], are trained for 1800 steps at a LoRA rank of 64 and a learning rate of 10−3. G𝑐is trained for another 4k iterations during distance-aware sampling. For the first 2800 iterations, optimization involves both a reference image and a repaired novel view image, with the weight of Lrep progressively decayed from 1.0 to 0.1. The final 1200-step training only involves reference views. The whole process of GaussianObject takes about 30 minutes on a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU for 4 input images at a 779 × 520 resolution. For more details, please refer to the Appendix.

We evaluate GaussianObject on three datasets suited for sparseview 360◦object reconstruction with varying input views, including Mip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2021], OmniObject3D [Wu et al. 2023], and OpenIllumination [Liu et al. 2023a]. Additionally, we use an iPhone 13 to capture four views of some daily-life objects to show the COLMAP-free performance. SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023] is used to obtain masks of the target objects.

4 EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Implementation Details 4.2 Datasets 4.3 Evaluation Sparse 360◦Reconstruction Performance. We evaluate the performance of GaussianObject against several reconstruction baselines, including the vanilla 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] with random initialization and DVGO [Sun et al. 2022], and various few-view reconstruction models on the three datasets. Compared methods of RegNeRF [Niemeyer et al. 2022], DietNeRF [Jain et al. 2021], SparseNeRF [Guangcong et al. 2023], and ZeroRF [Shi et al. 2024b] utilize a variety of regularization techniques. Besides, FSGS [Zhu et al. 2024] is also built upon Gaussian splatting with SfM-point initialization. Note that we supply extra SfM points to FSGS so that it can work with the highly sparse 360◦setting. Since camera pose estimation often suffers from scale and positional errors compared to ground truth, we adopt the evaluation used for COLMAP-free methods under dense view settings [Fu et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2021]. All models are trained using publicly released codes. Table 2 and 3 present the view-synthesis performance of GaussianObject compared to existing methods on the MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, and OpenIllumination datasets. Experiments show that GaussianObject consistently achieves SOTA results in all datasets, especially in the perceptual quality – LPIPS. Although GaussianObject is designed to address extremely sparse input views, it still outperforms other methods with more input views, i.e. 6 and 9, further proving the effectiveness. Notably, GaussianObject excels with as few as 4 views and significantly improves LPIPS over FSGS from 0.0951 to 0.0498 on MipNeRF360. This improvement is critical, as LPIPS is a key indicator of perceptual quality [Park et al. 2021]. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 illustrate rendering results of various methods across different datasets with only 4 input views. We observe that GaussianObject achieves significantly better visual quality and fidelity than the competing models. We find that implicit representation based methods and random initialized 3DGS fail in extremely sparse settings, typically reconstructing objects as fragmented pixel patches. This confirms the effectiveness of integrating structure priors with explicit representations. Although ZeroRF exhibits competitive PSNR and SSIM on OpenIllumination, its renderings are blurred and lack details, as shown in Fig. 6. In contrast, GaussianObject demonstrates fine-detailed reconstruction. This superior perceptual quality highlights the effectiveness of the Gaussian repair model. It is highly suggested to refer to comprehensive video comparisons included in supplementary materials. Comparison with LRMs. We further compare GaussianObject to recently popular LRM-like feed-forward reconstruction methods, i.e. LGM [Tang et al. 2024a] and TriplaneGaussian (TGS) [Zou et al. 2024] which are publicly available. The comparisons are shown in Table 4 on the challenging MipNeRF360 dataset. Given that TriplaneGaussian accommodates only a single image input, we feed it with frontal views of objects. LGM requires placing the target object at the world coordinate origin with cameras oriented towards it at an elevation of 0◦and azimuths of 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, and 270◦. Therefore, we report two versions of LGM – LGM-4 which uses four sparse captures as input views directly, and LGM-1 which uses MVDream [Shi et al. 2024a] to generate images that comply with LGM’s setup requirements following its original manner. Results show that the strict requirements among input views significantly hinder the sparse reconstruction performance of LRM-like models with in-the-wild captures. In contrast, GaussianObject does not require extensive pre-training, has no restrictions on input views, and can reconstruct any complex object in daily life.

Performance of CF-GaussianObject. CF-GaussianObject is evaluated on the MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D datasets, with results detailed in Table 2 and Fig. 5. Though CF-GaussianObject exhibits some performance degradation, it eliminates the need for precise camera parameters, significantly enhancing its practical utility. Its performance remains competitive compared to other SOTA methods that depend on accurate camera parameters. Notably, we observe that the performance degradation correlates with an increase in the number of input views, primarily due to declines in the accuracy of DUSt3R’s estimates as the number of views rises. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, comparative experiments on smartphone-captured images confirm the superior reconstruction capabilities and visual quality of CF-GaussianObject. More visualization of CF-GaussianObject can be found in our appendix and supplementary materials.

Particularly, omitting visual hull initialization results in a marked decrease in performance. Gaussian repair model setup and the Gaussian repair process significantly enhance visual

Ours w/o Repair w/o Setup Input Views FreeNeRF ZeroRF FSGS Ours (CF) GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting • 9 is achieved by leave-one-out training and perturbing the attributes of 3D Gaussians to create image pairs for fine-tuning a pre-trained image-conditioned ControlNet. Similarities can be found in Dreambooth [Ruiz et al. 2023], which aims to generate specific subject images from limited inputs. To validate the efficacy of our design, we evaluate the samples generated by our Gaussian repair model and other alternative structures. The first is implemented with Dreambooth [Raj et al. 2023; Ruiz et al. 2023], which embeds target object priors with semantic modifications. To make the output corresponding to the target object, we utilize SDEdit [Meng et al. 2022] to guide the image generation. Inspired by Song et al. [2023b], the second introduces a monocular depth conditioning ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023a], which is fine-tuned using data pair generation as in Sec. 3.4. We also assess the performance using masked depth conditioning. Furthermore, we consider Zero123-XL [Deitke et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2023c], a well-known single-image reconstruction model requiring object-centered input images with precise camera rotations and positions. Here, we manually align the coordinate system and select the closest image to the novel viewpoint as its reference. The results, as shown in Table 6 and Fig. 10, reveal that semantic modifications proposed by Dreambooth alone fail in 3D-coherent synthesis.

roughness and artifacts. Zero123-XL, while generating visually acceptable images, the multi-view structure consistency is lacking. In contrast, our model excels in both 3D consistency and detail fidelity, outperforming others qualitatively and quantitatively. Effect of View Numbers. We design experiments to evaluate the advantage of our method over different training views. As shown in Fig. 11, GaussianObject consistently outperforms vanilla 3DGS in varying numbers of training views. Besides, GaussianObject with 24 training views achieves performance comparable to that of 3DGS trained on all views (243).

GaussianObject demonstrates notable performance in sparse 360◦object reconstruction, yet several avenues for future research exist. In regions completely unobserved or insufficiently observed, our repair model may generate hallucinations, i.e., it may produce non-existent details, as shown in Fig. 12. However, these regions are inherently non-deterministic in information, and other methods also struggle in these areas. Additionally, due to the high sparsity level, our model is currently limited in capturing view-dependent effects. With such sparse data, our method cannot differentiate whether the appearance is view-dependent or inherent. Consequently, it ‘bakes in’ the view-dependent features (like reflected white light) onto the surface, resulting in an inability to display view-dependent appearance from novel viewpoints correctly and leading to some unintended artifacts as demonstrated in Fig. 13. Fine-tuning diffusion models with more view-dependent data may be a promising direction. Besides, integrating GaussianObject with surface reconstruction methods like 2DGS [Huang et al. 2024] and GOF [Yu et al. 2024] is a promising direction. Furthermore, CF-GaussianObject achieves competitive performance, but there is still a performance gap compared to precise camera parameters. An interesting exploration is to leverage confidence maps from matching methods for more accurate pose estimation.

4.5 Limitations and Future Work GaussianObject (Ours) 5.79 23.55 0.9220 This work was supported by the NSFC under Grant 62322604 and 62176159, and in part by the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project under Grant 2021SHZDZX0102. The authors express gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and to Deyu Wang for his assistance with figure drawing and Blender support.

In summary, GaussianObject is a novel framework designed for highquality 3D object reconstruction from extremely sparse 360◦views, based on 3DGS with real-time rendering capabilities. We design two main methods to achieve this goal: structure-prior-aided optimization for facilitating the multi-view consistency construction and a Gaussian repair model to remove artifacts caused by omitted or highly compressed object information. We also provide a COLMAPfree version that can be easily applied in real life with competitive performance. We sincerely hope that GaussianObject can advance daily-life applications of reconstructing 3D objects, markedly reducing capture requirements and broadening application prospects.

OmniObject3D. OmniObject3D includes 6k real 3D objects in 190 large-vocabulary categories. We selected 17 objects from OmniObject3D [Wu et al. 2023]. The items chosen include: back-pack_016, box_043, broccoli_003, corn_007, dinosaur_006, flower_pot_007, gloves_009, guitar_002, hamburger_012, picnic_basket_009, pineapple_013, sandwich_003, suitcase_006, timer_010, toy_plane_005, toy_truck_037, and vase_012 for a fair evaluation. We manually choose camera views for training and use every eighth view left for testing. Most scenes are originally in 1080p resolution, while gloves_009 and timer_010 are in 720p resolution. To maintain consistency across all scenes, we upscaled the images from these two scenes to 1080p resolution. All the images are downsampled to a factor of 2×.

OpenIllumination. OpenIllumination is a real-world dataset captured by the LightStage. We use the sparse OpenIllumination dataset proposed in ZeroRF [Shi et al. 2024b]. Note that ZeroRF re-scaled and re-centered the camera poses to align the target object with the world center. We test on the sparse OpenIllumination dataset [Liu et al. 2023a] with provided object masks, which are generated by SAM and train-test splits, downscaling the images by a factor of 4×, following the same experimental setting as in Shi et al. [2024b].

Our-collected Unposed Images. To better align with daily usage, we captured four images of common objects using an iPhone 13 from approximately front, back, left, and right directions without strict requirements on camera positioning or angles. We employed DUSt3R [Wang et al. 2024a] to predict the camera parameters, including intrinsics and poses, for these images. Additionally, we used SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023] along with the iPhone’s native segmentation features to perform image segmentation. All comparative methods also included these camera parameters and masks.

The contents of this appendix include:

To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we employ SAM-based methods [Cen et al. 2023; Kirillov et al. 2023] to generate consistent object masks of test views. While this process is necessary for benchmarking in our study, it is not required for practical applications. In real-world scenarios, the system necessitates only four masks from captured images, which are straightforward to obtain with any segmentation method.

A APPENDIX A.1 Dataset Details MipNeRF360. The sparse MipNeRF360 dataset, derived from the dataset provided by Barron et al. [2021], focuses on three scenes containing a primary object: bonsai, garden, and kitchen. For performance evaluation, the scenes are tested using images downsampled by a factor of 4×, following the train-test splits from Wu et al. [2024].

GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting • 13 We build our GaussianObject upon 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] and Threestudio [Guo et al. 2023]. For visual hull reconstruction, we adopt a coarse-to-fine approach, starting with rough spatial sampling to estimate the bounding box and then proceeding to detailed sampling within it. Since the sparse input views cannot provide sufficient multi-view consistency, we reconstruct all objects with only two degrees of spherical harmonics (SH). We adopt the densification and opacity reset methods from vanilla 3DGS, conducting densification every 100 iterations and resetting opacity every 1,000 iterations. As for floater elimination, we start it from 500 iterations and conduct it every 500 iterations until 6k iterations. The adaptive threshold 𝜏is initially set to the mean plus the standard deviation of the average distance calculated via KNN and is linearly decreased to 0 in 6k iterations. The loss weight for Lgs is set to: 𝜆SSIM = 0.2, 𝜆m = 0.001 and Ld = 0.0005. For the Gaussian repair model setup, we use leave-one-out training to generate image pairs and 3D Noise 𝜖𝑠. We use the visual hull corresponding to 𝑁reference images to initialize all 3DGS models during leave-one-out training. We add noises to all the attributes of 3D Gaussians except for SH coefficients. Whenever we need a data pair from adding 3D noises, we use the mean 𝜇Δ and variance 𝜎Δ to generate new noisy Gaussians for rendering, thus enabling sufficient data generation. All the images are constantly padded or center-cropped before being fed into the Gaussian repair model to preserve the real ratio of the target object. At the first iteration of training the Gaussian repair model, manual noise generated according to distribution is used for training with a 100% probability. Each time training is conducted with manual noise, this probability is reduced by 0.5%, to utilize cached images from leave-one-out training increasingly, as illustrated in Algorithm 1. Referred to Dreambooth [Ruiz et al. 2023], the [V] used for objectspecific text prompt is “xxy5syt00”. We apply LoRA [Hu et al. 2022] in the fine-tuning process. LoRA optimizes a learnable low-rank residual matrix Δ𝑊𝑖= 𝐴𝑖𝐵𝑖, where 𝐴𝑖∈R𝑚×𝑟, 𝐵𝑖∈R𝑟×𝑛. The hyperparameter of the LoRA rank 𝑟≪𝑚,𝑛. We add LoRA layers to all embedding, linear, and convolution layers of the transformer blocks in the diffusion U-Net, the ControlNet U-Net, and the CLIP model. LoRA rank 𝑟is set to 64, and the learning rate is set to 10−3. We fine-tune the Gaussian repair model for 1800 steps, optimized using an AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter 2019] with 𝛽 values of (0.9, 0.999). For the Gaussian repair process, we optimize the coarse 3DGS model for 4k steps, involving both a reference image and a repaired novel view image for the first 2800 steps supervised by Lrep and Lgs together, with the weight of Lrep progressively decayed from 1.0 to 0.1. The final 1200-step training only involves reference views. Based on the camera poses of 𝑁reference views, we estimate an elliptic trajectory that encircles the object and find 𝑁points on the trajectory closest to the reference views, respectively. These 𝑁points divide the ellipse into 𝑁segments of the arc. On each arc segment, novel views are only sampled from the middle 80% of the arc (repair path). The remaining arcs constitute reference paths. To expedite training, we avoid using the time-consuming DDIM process [Song et al. 2021] for every novel view rendering. Instead, A.2 Implementation Details

Algorithm 1 Gaussian Repair Model Data Generation Algorithm we employ cached images for optimization. Specifically, at the beginning of every 200 iterations, we sample and repair two novel views from each repair path. Throughout these 200 iterations, we utilize these images to repair 3D Gaussians. We set the weights for Lrep as Input: Gaussian Repair Model R, Coarse 3DGS Model G𝑐, Mean 𝜇Δ,𝑎and Variance 𝜎Δ,𝑎for Each Attribute 𝑎of G𝑐, 𝑁Leave-oneout 3DGS Models { ˆG𝑖𝑐}𝑁−1 𝑖=0 1: 𝑃manual ←1 11: 𝑥′ ←𝑥′(G𝑐(𝜖𝑠), 𝜋𝑖) 9: 𝑎←𝑎+ 𝜖𝑠,𝑎 10: end for 12: 𝑃manual ←0.995 × 𝑃manual 13: else 15: end if 16: Optimize R with data pair (𝑥′,𝑥𝑖) 14: 𝑥′ ←𝑥′( ˆG𝑖𝑐, 𝜋𝑖) 17: end for 2: Sample 𝑝from 𝑈[0, 1] 6: G𝑐(𝜖𝑠) ←G𝑐 7: for all attribute 𝑎of G𝑐except for SH coefficients do 3: for each iteration do 4: Sample an index 𝑖from {0, 1, . . . , 𝑁−1} 5: if 𝑝< 𝑃manual then 8: Sample 𝜖𝑠,𝑎from 𝑁(𝜇Δ,𝑎, 𝜎2 Δ,𝑎) GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting • 15 where ˆ𝜋ref∗denotes the refined camera pose, and ˆ𝜋ref 0 represents the initial camera pose from DUSt3R. 𝜆pose is introduced to ensure the refined poses do not deviate excessively from the initial ones, which follows: 𝜆1 = 0.5, 𝜆2 = 0.5 and 𝜆𝑝= 2.0 accross all experiments. We employ densification and opacity resetting to regulate the number of Gaussians. The Gaussian densification process is effective from 400 to 3600 steps. The Gaussian model undergoes densification and pruning at intervals of every 100 steps, and its opacity is reset every 500 steps. For CF-GaussianObject, we modify the DUSt3R [Wang et al. 2024a] pipeline to better suit our task. We assume that all cameras share the same intrinsic, while the original DUSt3R predicts different camera focal lengths for each view. We initially use the average camera focal estimated from input views and further optimize it using DUSt3R’s global optimization process. Background points are removed from DUSt3R’s point cloud P using object masks and the predicted camera poses via a back-projection algorithm. The resultant P is much sparser than the visual hull point cloud, missing points on unseen surfaces and object fillers. we augment P with 10% of the points from the visual hull point cloud to densify the initial 3D Gaussian points. During the first 4000 steps of the 3DGS initial optimization process, we employ the tracking losses from MonoGS [Matsuki et al. 2024] and InstantSplat [Fan et al. 2024] to further optimize the camera poses ˆΠref predicted by DUSt3R.

is set to 0.0005 in our experiments. To evaluate CF-GaussianObject, we align the SfM camera poses with the noisy ones and optimize each test camera for up to 400 steps with the same loss during test time.

FSGS [Zhu et al. 2024] requires SfM points generated from the input images, which are too sparse in our setting of 4 input views. Alternatively, we randomly pick 𝑁pick points from the SfM points with full images as input:

where 𝑘sparse is the number of input images, 𝑘all is the total number of images, and 𝑁all is the total number of points.

A.4.2 Performance of CF-GaussianObject. Our COLMAP-free CFGaussianObject bypasses the traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline requirements, enabling application to casually captured images. Utilizing an iPhone 13, we capture four images of common objects and obtain their corresponding masks using SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023]. We then employ CF-GaussianObject for the reconstruction of these images, with the results of the novel view synthesis displayed in Fig. 14. CF-GaussianObject delivers high-quality reconstructions from just four images without the need for precise camera parameters, producing images with exceptional visual quality and detailed richness. These results underscore CF-GaussianObject’s effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity reconstruction from sparsely captured real-world images, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications.

A.3 Experiment Details of Comparison A.4.1 Per-scene Performance. We provide per-scene qualitative metrics of MipNeRF360 in Tab. 10, Tab. 11 and Tab. 12; of OmniObject3D in Tab. 13, Tab. 14, Tab. 15, Tab. 16, Tab. 17 and Tab. 18; of OpenIllumination in Tab. 19 and Tab. 20. Additional qualitative comparisons on the OpenIllumination dataset are shown in Fig. 19.

A.4.3 Comparison with DUSt3R. To further show the effectiveness of our design, we present qualitative comparisons between CFGaussianObject and DUSt3R [Wang et al. 2024a] in Fig. 16. These results confirm that the strong performance stems from our design. Overall, these findings highlight the generalizability of CFGaussianObject and its potential for real-world applications.

A.4 More Experimental Results 𝑁pick = max  150, 𝑘sparse 𝑘all 𝑁all  , (13) A.4.4 Influence of Gaussian repair process. We provide extra validations on our Gaussian repair process. Figure 15 illustrates the distribution of coarse 3D Gaussians and the refined distribution after the Gaussian repair. This comparison clearly demonstrates the significant enhancement in geometry achieved by our repair process. We also provide qualitative samples of the Gaussian repair model in Fig. 20, showing that the Gaussian repair model can effectively generate high-quality and consistent images from multiple views.

A.4.5 Training Time Comparison. We show the training time of GaussianObject and the various baselines on one single RTX 3090 GPU in Table 7. GaussianObject can be finished around 30 minutes, much faster than previous methods with higher quality. The process breakdown for GaussianObject is as follows: Initial optimization with structure priors takes approximately 1 minute; Gaussian repair model setup requires about 15 minutes; and Gaussian repair with distance-aware sampling lasts around 14 minutes. For the COLMAP-free version, we incorporate a customized diffgaussian-rasterization module during the coarse GS optimization. This module, which is not used in the standard GaussianObject nor the repair model setup and Gaussian repair, necessitates additional computations for gradient descent on camera poses and uses a faster rasterization module elsewhere. The training time for CFGaussianObject typically totals about 33 minutes, broken down as follows: DUSt3R [Wang et al. 2024a] completes in roughly 17 seconds; initial optimization with structure priors takes about 3 DietNeRF [Jain et al. 2021] 8h+ RegNeRF [Niemeyer et al. 2022] 48h+ FreeNeRF [Yang et al. 2023] 24h+ SparseNeRF [Guangcong et al. 2023] 24h+ ZeroRF [Shi et al. 2024b] ∼35min ReconFusion [Wu et al. 2024] 8h+ GaussianObject ∼30min CF-GaussianObject (ours) ∼33min

A.4.9 Performance with view distribution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of GaussianObject on the ‘kitchen’ scene from the MipNeRF360 dataset across various view distributions. We systematically report the angles between input views in the ‘view distribution’ column of Table 9, with the first row reflecting the configuration used in the manuscript. Results reveal that GaussianObject consistently achieves robust performance across diverse view distributions, a capability that eludes many current Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) [Tang et al. 2024a; Xu et al. 2024a; Zhang et al. 2024]. This robustness is crucial for practical applications where varied viewpoints are common.

A.4.7 Performance on Reference and Repair Path. The rendering capabilities of GaussianObject are evaluated on both the reference and repair paths. To ensure the utmost fidelity to the reference views, the Gaussian repair process is exclusively applied along the repair path. Fig. 18 illustrates that GaussianObject delivers exceptional visual quality across both the reference and repair paths. Such results highlight the efficacy of our Gaussian repair process. GaussianObject consistently produces high fidelity and visual excellence renderings, irrespective of whether the views are from regions with sufficient or insufficient coverage.

A.4.8 Performance with Varying Views. We demonstrate the performance of GaussianObject under various training views in Fig. 17. As more views are provided, GaussianObject can reconstruct more details. This demonstrates the model’s capacity to leverage additional perspectives for improved accuracy and detail in the reconstructed output. Specifically, with an increasing number of views, the visual quality of the renderings was significantly enhanced, reducing artifacts and producing finer details. This improvement highlights the robustness and scalability of GaussianObject in handling complex visual data.

minutes due to the customized diff-gaussian-rasterization module; Gaussian repair model setup remains at 15 minutes; and Gaussian repair with distance-aware sampling also takes about 14 minutes.

A.4.6 Robustness of Random Noise. Diffusion models rely on adding random noise followed by denoising to generate images; hence, their performance is heavily dependent on the random seed used. GaussianObject also employs a diffusion model to refine 3D Gaussian, so the diversity inherent in diffusion could affect the reconstruction quality of GaussianObject. To mitigate this diversity, we finetune the diffusion model and devise a distance-aware sampling strategy for Gaussian repair. To validate this, we conduct 10 independent experiments with different random seeds, and the results are presented in Table 8. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our design, demonstrating that randomness has little influence on our performance.

ControlNet-Tile, based on Stable Diffusion v1.5, is designed to repair low-resolution or low-fidelity images by taking them as conditions. In our ablation study, we use other diffusion models as our Gaussian repair model in Sec.4.4. First, we use Stable Diffusion XL Image-to-Image [Meng et al. 2022], which cannot directly take images as input conditions. Therefore, we add 50% Gaussian noise to the novel view images and use the model to generate high-fidelity images by denoising the noisy images. Additionally, we evaluate ControlNet-ZoeDepth based on Stable Diffusion XL. ControlNet-ZoeDepth, which takes the ZoeDepth [Bhat et al. 2023] as a condition, is used to generate images aligned with the depth map. However, ZoeDepth may incorrectly assume that a single object with a white background is on a white table, leading to erroneous depth map predictions. In such cases, we test two settings: one using the entire predicted depth map and another using the object-masked depth map. Due to the ambiguity of monocular predicted depth, we add partial noise on the input image to preserve the image information, similar to SDEdit. Specifically, we add 50% Gaussian noise to the novel view images and set the weight scale of the ControlNet model to 0.55. In this experimental setup, we obtained the results of the ablation experiments on the structure of the Gaussian repair model.

We prepare four sets of video comparisons for evaluation. The first set, videos_1, features videos rendered along trajectories encircling several objects, showcasing the performance of all tested models. These videos are organized by scene and the number of input views and are placed in different directories for ease of analysis. In the second video set, videos_2, we provide more experiment videos. Each video is edited to demonstrate our results clearly. The video titled refresh.mp4 compares all the tested models with GaussianObject on 9 scenes with 4 input views. Videos labeled with the suffix _compare.mp4 focus on comparing individual methods with GaussianObject. The video titled transfer_3DGS_to_GaussianObject.mp4 sequentially illustrates the enhancements we have implemented on the 3DGS, detailing each step of our improvement process. Additionally, the video COLMAP_free.mp4 shows our COLMAP-free experiments using our own collected unposed images, presenting both the input images and reconstruction results, along with comparisons to other methods. In the third video set, videos_3, we present videos from COLMAPfree experiments. Each video is labeled according to the dataset, scene, and number of input views involved in the experiment.
