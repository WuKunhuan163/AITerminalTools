      "abstract": "The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models.\nThe tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data.\nThe resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the\nconstraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred\ninflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\\gtrsim 2 \\sigma$. Here we\nshow that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between\n$n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB\ndatasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological\nmodel. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary\nmodels, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the\nBAO-CMB tension is resolved.",
