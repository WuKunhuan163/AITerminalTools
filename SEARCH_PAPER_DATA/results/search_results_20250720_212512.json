      "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video\nframes can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,\nemploying separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing\ntemporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt\nunsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex\nscenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding\nfor Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user\ninstructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated\nannotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.\nFirst, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the\ninstruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through\ninstruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection\nto pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we\nconstruct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed\ntemporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding.",

This problem, which occurs\nin spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number\nof inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular\nwill arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect\ndifferent facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is\ndirectly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\\\"odinger picture\nof evolution, and of evolution via \"many-fingered time.\" One requires a\ncondition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general\nthis equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it\nis determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard\ncondition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which\nalso may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the\nstate in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the\nnon-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of\nthese approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved\nperformance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often\nsignificantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry\nbreaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for\ncertain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a\nrigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models\nwith local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.\nTo this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the\nmathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check\n(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees\nextensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional\nassumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the\nlow-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an\nasymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the\nlandscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of\nthe total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --\nwhich we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and\ntreats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those\nwith short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our\nresults apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,\nand while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family\nof codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random\nregular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space.
